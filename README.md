# Net-Benefit-of-Movement-NBM-Algorithm
This project is refers to the NBM algorithm in a paper called "A discrete particle swarm optimization for lot-streaming flowshop scheduling problem", proposed by Chao-TangTsenga and Ching-JongLiao in 2008.
This is the link to the paper: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2007.08.030

All algorithm in their paper was write in C++, so I decided to realize the NBM algorithm by python.
